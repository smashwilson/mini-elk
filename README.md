# Mini ELK

This is me messing around with an ELK stack in Docker. My goal is to get a Docker container to log to ELK and investigate using grok formats to pack and index various kinds of data.

## Prerequisites

 * [docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/). I prefer using [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) on the Mac as a docker host environment.
 * [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Running

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
